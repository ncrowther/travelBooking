## RPA Bot

The RPA bot checks the desintation in the travel.state.gov website.    The bot takes as input the desination, and the output is the travel advisory with a status of true meaning it is ok to travel, and false meaning it is not.

### Installing and Running

#### Prerequisites

You will need:

* Java 11+ installed
* Environment variable JAVA_HOME set accordingly
* Maven 3.5.2+ installed

When using native image compilation, you will also need:

* GraalVM 20 installed
* Environment variable GRAALVM_HOME set accordingly
* Note that GraalVM native image compilation typically requires other packages (glibc-devel, zlib-devel and gcc) to be installed too, please refer to GraalVM installation documentation for more details.

#### Compile and Run in Local Dev Mode

```sh
mvn clean package quarkus:dev
```

NOTE: With dev mode of Quarkus you can take advantage of hot reload for business assets like processes, rules and decision
tables and java code. No need to redeploy or restart your running application.

#### Compile and Run using Local Native Image

Note that this requires GRAALVM_HOME to point to a valid GraalVM installation

```sh
mvn clean package -Pnative
```

To run the generated native executable, generated in `target/`, execute

```sh
./target/kogito-travel-agency-{version}-runner
```

    "country" : "US",
    "begin" : "2019-12-10T00:00:00.000+02:00",
